# This is R

## You Need A Programme Called R and RStudio Too

You need R to be running in the background while you use the nicer-to-use RStudio.

<br>

When using a university computer, download R and RStudio from AppsAnywhere. 

* Click the AppsAnywhere icon, scroll down to "Cran R" and click launch. 
* Once R has opened and downloaded onto the computer you can close it. 
* Now go back into Apps Anywhere to find RStudio and launch that.

<br>

## Basic Layout

When you first open RStudio, you will see three panels:

  * The interactive R console (left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![](./images/RStudio_screenshot.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of Rstudio showing eleven menus at the top left. One panel covers the left half with text about the R software. The right is divided into two panels with text saying that the environment is empty in the top panel and a display of the current file directory in the bottom panel."}

Once you open files, such as R scripts another panel will open in the top left.

* Click on the white square with the plus in green icon top left.

The first screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting an icon which is a white square with a plus inside a green circle. The second screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting a menu item that reads R Script followed by the associated keyboard shortcut, Ctrl + Shift + N."}



<br>

## Working in RStudio
We will write code in our .R file (script) and whenever we want, tell RStudio to run our code.

<br>

The simplest thing you can do with R is use it as a calculator. Type the below into the script:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

<br>

To run a line of your script code in the R console, click on the <kbd>Run</kbd> button at the top right of the script.

R tries to run your code and returns a result in the console window on the bottom left.
